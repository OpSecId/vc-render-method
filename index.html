This specification describes mechanisms that can be used to represent a
Verifiable Credential through a visual, auditory, or haptic medium. It covers
rendering a Verifiable Credential to a physical document, digital image,
screen reader, or braille output.

      <p>
This is an experimental specification and is undergoing regular revisions. It is
not fit for production deployment.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
Rendering methods can be used when the <a>issuer</a> has a specific way that
they want to express a <a>verifiable credential</a> to an observer through
a visual, auditory, or haptic mechanism. For example, an <a>issuer</a> of an
employee badge credential might want to include rich imagery of their corporate
logo and specific placement of employee information in specific areas of the
badge. They might also want to provide an audio read out of the important
aspects of the badge for individuals that have accessibility needs related
to their eyesight.

      <section id="conformance">
        <p>
A <dfn>conforming render method</dfn> is any concrete expression of the data
model that complies with the normative statements in this specification.
Specifically, all relevant normative statements in Sections
<a href="#data-model"></a> and <a href="#algorithms"></a>
of this document MUST be enforced.
        </p>

        <p>
A <dfn class="lint-ignore">conforming processor</dfn> is any algorithm realized
as software and/or hardware that generates or consumes a
<a>conforming render method</a>. Conforming processors MUST produce errors when
non-conforming documents are consumed.
        </p>
        <p>
This document also contains examples that contain JSON and JSON-LD content. Some
of these examples contain characters that are invalid JSON, such as inline
comments (`//`) and the use of ellipsis (`...`) to denote
information that adds little value to the example. Implementers are cautioned to
remove this content if they desire to use the information as valid JSON or
JSON-LD.

      <h2>Data Model</h2>

      <p>
The following sections outline the data model that is used by this specification
for rendering methods
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>The `renderMethod` Property</h3>

        <p>
The `renderMethod` property is a
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#reserved-extension-points">
reserved extension point</a> in the Verifiable Credentials Data Model
specification [[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]]. An <a>issuer</a> can utilize this
property in a <a>verifiable credential</a> to express one or more preferred
render methods.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><var>renderMethod</var></dt>
          <dd>
The value of the `renderMethod` property MUST specify one or
more rendering methods that can be used by software to express the
<a>verifiable credential</a> using a visual, auditory, or haptic mechanism. Each
`renderMethod` value MUST specify its `type`, for example,
`SvgRenderingTemplate2023`. The precise contents of each rendering
hint is determined by the specific `renderMethod` `type`
definition.

      <h2>Algorithms</h2>

      <p>
The following sections outline the algorithms that is used by this specification
for rendering methods.
