## Verifiable Credentials Rendering Methods

When using Verifiable Credentials, rendering methods can be used when the issuer
has a specific way that they want to express a verifiable credential to an
observer through a visual, auditory, or haptic mechanism. For example, an issuer
of an employee badge credential might want to include rich imagery of their
corporate logo and specific placement of employee information in specific areas
of the badge. They might also want to provide an audio read out of the important
aspects of the badge for individuals that have accessibility needs related to
their eyesight.

We encourage contributions meeting the
[Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). While we prefer the creation of
issues and Pull Requests in the GitHub repository, discussions also occur on the
[public-credentials](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/) mailing list.
